      "description": "Fungibility basically points out to the right for exchanging a product or asset with other products or assets of the same kind. Fungibility ensures the implications towards the equal value of assets. The concept is helpful for simplifying trade and exchange processes. Fungibility is evident in cases where two objects or assets are similar to each other in design, and each unit of them could be exchanged for one another."
